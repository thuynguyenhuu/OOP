# NguyenHuuThuy_ITCSIU22141_IT069IU Project

This project contains the source code for the Object-oriented programming laboratory 1 report.

## How to Compile and Run the Code
---------------------------------------------------
# Lab1_Q1

This folder contains two Java files:
- `Rectangle.java`: This file contains the Rectangle class with Two attributes (width and height), getter method, and visualize method.
- `TestRectangle.java`: This is the main class with a main method and uses the Rectangle class.
# Navigate to the Lab1_Q1 folder
cd src/Lab1_Q1

# Compile the Rectangle.java file, TestRectangle.java file
```bash
javac Rectangle.java TestRectangle.java

# Run the compiled TestRectangle class
java TestRectangle
---------------------------------------------------
# Lab1_Q2

This folder contains two Java files:
- `Triangle.java`: This file contains the Rectangle class with Three attributes (the length of 3 sides), constructor and get methods, verify() method.
- `TriangleVerification.java`: This is the main class with a main method and uses the Triangle class.
# Navigate to the Lab1_Q1 folder
cd src/Lab1_Q2

# Compile the Rectangle.java file, TestRectangle.java file
```bash
javac Triangle.java TriangleVerification.java

# Run the compiled TestRectangle class
java TriangleVerification.java
---------------------------------------------------
# Lab1_Q3

This folder contains two Java files:
- `Point.java`: This file contains the Rectangle class with Two attributes (coordinates x and y), constructor method, and distance method.
- `DistanceTest.java`: This is the main class with a main method and uses the Point class.
# Navigate to the Lab1_Q1 folder
cd src/Lab1_Q3

# Compile the Rectangle.java file, TestRectangle.java file
```bash
javac Point.java DistanceTest.java

# Run the compiled TestRectangle class
java DistanceTest.java
