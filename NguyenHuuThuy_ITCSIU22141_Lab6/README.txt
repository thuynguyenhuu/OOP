1. Is it valid to define an abstract class that only contains fully implemented (i.e. not abstract) methods. If so, will Java let you create instances of this type? Try it.

- Yes, defining an abstract class in Java that only contains fully implemented (i.e. not abstract) methods is valid.
- You cannot create instances of an abstract class. 


2. Justify why the work() method is abstract. 

- The work() method is abstract because the work performed by each type of employee is different.
